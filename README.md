## 🎯 The Problem

Most existing MCPs are built as **simple API wrappers** without considering the unique constraints of AI agents:

- **Limited context window** → Tokens are expensive
- **No persistent memory** → State must be managed differently  
- **Pattern-matching decisions** → Needs clear, consistent interfaces
- **Tendency toward verbose exploration** → Requires guardrails

The result? MCPs that waste tokens, require multiple round-trips, and lack safety controls.

## 💡 The Solution

This standard defines **best practices across 12 critical dimensions** to create MCPs that are efficient, robust, and agent-friendly.

## 🔑 The 12 Pillars

### 1. Context Window Optimization
- `returnOnlyIds` mode for lists
- `compact` mode with minimal fields
- Cursor-based pagination
- Count-only operations
- Summary-only batch responses

### 2. Atomic vs Composite Operations
- `search_and_action` composites
- `get_or_create` patterns
- `dryRun` preview mode
- Internal batching

### 3. Error Handling & Resilience
- Partial success reporting
- Structured error responses
- Internal retry logic
- Graceful degradation

### 4. Authentication & Multi-Account
- Account ID parameters
- Silent token refresh
- Device flow support
- Secure credential storage

### 5. Discovery & Introspection
- `get_capabilities()` tool
- Enum discovery
- Rich tool descriptions
- Schema introspection

### 6. State & Caching
- ETag/conditional requests
- Delta/incremental sync
- Internal caching with TTL

### 7. Resource Efficiency
- Lazy loading / expand parameters
- Exclude heavy fields by default
- Truncation with metadata

### 8. Semantic Grouping
- `{resource}_{action}` naming
- Danger indicators
- Read/write separation

### 9. Audit & Observability
- Action history logging
- Undo capabilities
- Change summaries

### 10. Platform-Specific Patterns
- Email MCP requirements
- Calendar MCP requirements
- File Storage MCP requirements
- CRM/Database MCP requirements

### 11. Agent-Friendly Output
- JSON responses always
- Consistent schemas
- Actionable IDs
- Status enums

### 12. Safety & Guardrails
- Maximum batch sizes
- Two-stage deletion
- Confirmation tokens
- Rate limiting
- Read-only mode

## 📊 Compliance Scoring

Use the [compliance checklist](./checklists/compliance-checklist.md) to evaluate any MCP:

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 30-36 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent - Production ready |
| 24-29 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good - Minor improvements needed |
| 18-23 | ⭐⭐⭐ Adequate - Significant gaps |
| 12-17 | ⭐⭐ Poor - Major refactoring needed |
| 0-11  | ⭐ Failing - Rebuild recommended |

└── references/
    ├── patterns.md       # Detailed implementation patterns
    └── platforms.md      # Platform-specific requirements
```

### Installation

**Claude Code:** Copy `skills/mcp-excellence/` to `~/.claude/skills/`

**Claude.ai:** Zip the folder and upload via Settings > Features

### Key Features:
- Automatic context window optimization
- Built-in batch operations
- Error handling patterns
- Safety guardrails by default

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Evaluating an Existing MCP

1. Open the [Compliance Checklist](./checklists/compliance-checklist.md)
2. Score each category
3. Identify gaps and prioritize improvements

### Building a New MCP

1. Add the [Claude skill](./skills/mcp-excellence.md) to your Claude configuration
2. Provide your API documentation
3. Claude will generate a standard-compliant MCP

### Upgrading an Existing MCP

1. Review your current implementation against the standard
2. Prioritize: Context Window → Safety → Operations → Rest
3. Implement changes incrementally

## 📚 Examples

### Before (Anti-Pattern)
```javascript
// Returns 500 full email objects
const emails = await mcp.search_emails({ query: "from:newsletter" });
// Then loops to delete each one
for (const email of emails) {
  await mcp.delete_email({ id: email.id });
}
// Result: 501 API calls, ~50,000 tokens consumed
```

### After (Excellence Standard)
```javascript
// Single composite operation with preview
const result = await mcp.search_and_action({
  query: "from:newsletter",
  action: "trash",
  dryRun: false
});
// Result: 1 API call, ~100 tokens consumed
// Returns: { processed: 247, failed: 0 }
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This standard was developed through hands-on experience building and enhancing multiple MCPs, identifying patterns that waste AI agent resources, and synthesizing best practices that the industry was lacking.
